Hi Guys,

Here are some links to help you get started with GitHub.
First make a user account on github. You can change the avatar on gravatar if you care.
Then you need to make a RSA public key and put it on github:
http://help.github.com/linux-key-setup/

After that you can use the reference to do most things
http://gitref.org/

The basic concept is that make a change to a file. You then commit the file and push it to the repo.
The repo is the place online that all the files are stored.
You need to pull changes from the repo to see what everyone else has done.
